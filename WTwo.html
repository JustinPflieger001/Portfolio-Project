            Todesrand is a multi-continental planet, and is called home by many people. D’aahrc is the Main continent, and holds many races within its borders. In the center is a walled citadel, known as the Bastion, where the High Elves reside. Surrounding the Bastion is another city, Derrick, which is open to all races. In the snowy north west lies The Market, a sanctuary town filled with stores, pubs, and inns of all types. To the right of The Market is the Enchanted Forest, a place of magical creatures lit by the bioluminescence of the mushroom trees. West of the Bastion is the woodlands, home of the wood elves, forest gnomes, and other creatures of the forest. In the south lies the Volcano, called The Ember Mountain, surrounding is a spiked mountain wall, and within these walls lie the Orcs. Right of the orcish land is the Oblivion Summit, a mountain reaching heights of 29,029ft. The bottom of the mountain holds The Smiths of the Lost Age, a clan of Gnomes and Dwarves dedicated to technological advancements, in their hold, The Forge. Above the Smiths are the AArakocra, living atop the tall mountain trees in the city called The Nest. Above the Bird-folk, at the mountain’s peak, lies the Goliath’s city of Elen Vu, a place few outsiders have seen. South of the summit, are the Merfolkian Isles, home to Tortles, Tritons, and other sea creatures. West of the Bastion is the Fin Brod Golt, home of the Dragonborn clans. In the clouds lies the city of the Aasimar, commonly called The Heavens.

            Todesrand is a world plagued by Corruption, death, and evil. The main continent, known simply as D’aahrc, is fueled by hatred and fear. The High Elven race had taken power in the Battle of King’s Betrayal, and has been ruling the land with an iron fist, creating the Malignant Era. The Battle of King’s Betrayal took place in the Regression Age(200 years ago), and lasted 50 years. The war devastated the nation's infrastructure,caused widespread famines, and one out of every four people were unemployed. The High Elves used their riches to buy their power and fixed parts of the country. An elven Mage raised mountains and sealed the Orcs in around The Ember Mountain.
