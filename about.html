                    Hello, my name is Justin Pflieger, a student of Dr. Floyd B. Buchanan High School and the Center for Advanced Research and Technology(Cart) in Clovis, California. I have always had a deep interest in technology and programming, which has lead to taking the Web Application Development and Game Design courses at Cart. So far in these courses I have learned to use: Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS), Javascript, Photoshop, Wireframe.cc, and more. I have previously been employed at: Holiday Inn Express and Suites as a houseman, Carmel Valley Lodge as an assistant caterer, and at Anton Inn as assistant caterer and houseman.

                    My interest in technology has led me to find many hobbies within the field. Art is one of my biggest and most important hobbies because I would like to go into game design in the future. Another hobby is coding, which is another major piece in the game making branch of technology. Photo and video editing are some of the hobbies that I am best at, and can be extremely useful. These hobbies have taught me many life skills and qualities. One such skill is patience, many of these hobbies take up time, with little reward throughout, making them slightly more difficult to complete. Another skill is scheduling, I have learned to set a schedule for myself for each task and/or section of work to maximize efficiency and get the best work I can. This website contains everything about me from work I have done in my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> , my <a href="resume.html">résumé</a>, and where to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me: such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-pflieger-52571415a/">LinkedIn </a> , my phone number, etc.
